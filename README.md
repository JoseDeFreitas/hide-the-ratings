## Notes

The websites covered by this userscript are websites more considered like social media (commonly
known as "tracking websites"). They often feature the user creating an account, lists, following
other people, earning badges, etc. Because of this, websites like Metacritic, which main focus
is ratings are reviews, are not covered by this userscript (since people don't ofter go to these
kind of websites to look for more information or to add them to their lists).
